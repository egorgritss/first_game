Enemies amount can be changed in CMap constructor. By default amount is 3.
     
      Controls: WASD
      W - move up
      A - move left
      S - move down
      D - move right
      Q - quit
      ENTER - submit turn
     
     
      Game goal:
     
       U need to force all enemies eat to "0". If enemy will eat "0", it will turn into border(#). Player can also eat "0", it will give no effect.
     
     
       # - border
       x - enemy
       @ - player
       0 - enemy trap
       $ - dead player
     
     

     In this version u can't draw enemies or players at map. It will give no effect, but can cause some bugs. Map should contain only borders(#) and ' ' .
     If you dont know how the game works - don't change any part of code. It can destroy everything.
     Enemies and player will spawn automatically at the corners like this:
      ######
      #@  x#
      #x  x#
      ######
      
      
      
      You can create your own map using CMap constructor:   
      CMap x("####################################\n"  
             "#                                  #\n"
             "#                   ##             #\n"
             "#                   #0             #\n"
             "#                   ##             #\n"
             "#          ##                      #\n"
             "#          0#                      #\n"
             "#          ##         ###          #\n"
             "#                     #0#          #\n"
             "#                                  #\n"
             "####################################\n");
